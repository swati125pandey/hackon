**Aditi:** Let's get started on planning the Razorpay annual party. Any thoughts on dates?

**Rohit:** HR is suggesting mid-February, preferably a Friday so people can unwind properly.

**Mehul:** That works from the engineering side. No critical launches around that time.

**Pooja:** Great. For the theme, how about "Neon Night" or "Retro Vibes"?

**Rohit:** Retro Vibes feels more inclusive. People usually enjoy dressing up for it.

**Aditi:** Agreed. Let's tentatively lock Retro Vibes. What about the venue?

**Mehul:** An outdoor venue would be fun, but we should have a backup in case of weather issues.

**Pooja:** There's a resort near Bangalore that fits our headcount and budget. I'll share the details by tomorrow.

**Rohit:** Speaking of budget, we should try to keep everything within the allocated limit of 15 lakhs.

**Aditi:** Yes, we'll be mindful. Rohit, can you get the final headcount from HR by next Monday?

**Rohit:** Sure, I'll coordinate with the HR team and share the numbers.

**Mehul:** For entertainment, I suggest a DJ, some live music, and maybe a few internal performances.

**Pooja:** We can also add games or interactive zones. I'll create a list of activity ideas.

**Aditi:** Perfect. Mehul, can you check with the AV team about equipment requirements?

**Mehul:** Will do. I'll send an email today.

**Aditi:** Great progress everyone. Let's finalize details over the next few days and sync again on Friday. Meeting adjourned.
